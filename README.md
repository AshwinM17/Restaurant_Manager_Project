# Restaurant_Manager_Project
 I created a Customer Management portal in my High School. This project incorporated Python, MySQL (Database Management), Tkinter (Designing The frontend). The project is capable of providing a secure password protected platform for any restaurant to manage orders, customer records and make reservations for tables. It is fully ready for real world application and can even be modified to accommodate a variety of different applications.
