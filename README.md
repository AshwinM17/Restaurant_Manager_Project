# Restaurant_Manager_Project
 I created a Customer Management portal in my High School. This project incorporated Python, MySQL (Database Management), Tkinter (Designing The frontend). The project is capable of providing a secure password protected platform for any restaurant to manage orders, customer records and make reservations for tables. It is fully ready for real world application and can even be modified to accommodate a variety of different applications.

 To start you must have a local sql sever up and running and change the parameters of the connector in line 4.
 ## On Windows
Open 'Run' Window by using Win key + R

Type 'services.msc'

Now search for MySQL service based on the version that is installed.

Click on 'start' or 'restart' the service option.
